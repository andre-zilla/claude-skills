# Claude Code Custom Skills

A production-grade collection of 13 custom [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) skills for content creation, AI development, security auditing, defensive research, community management, and AI framework expertise.

These skills use advanced Claude Code features including `context: fork` for isolated execution, `allowed-tools` for precise tool access, dynamic context injection (`!`command``), skill chaining, and structured output templates.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone into your Claude Code skills directory
git clone https://github.com/andre-zilla/claude-skills.git ~/.claude/skills

# That's it — open Claude Code and type / to see all available skills
```

**Requirements:** [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/claude-code) installed and configured.

**Optional:** [Ghost Security plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-plugins) for automated security scanning (`/secure-review` and `/stack-check` use it if available, but work without it).

---

## Development Skills

### `/project-ideas`

Generates 5 buildable project ideas with diversity requirements.

```
/project-ideas
/project-ideas intermediate nextjs AI
/project-ideas beginner python automation exclude: chatbots
```

**Per idea:** Name, description, verified tech stack, features, APIs (with pricing), difficulty, build time, learning outcomes, content angle (episode count, wow factor), monetization potential, and **quick-start command** (`/app-scaffold [description]`).

**Diversity enforced:** At least 3 different stacks, 2 difficulty levels, 1 weekend project, 1 ambitious series project. Checks for similar existing projects via web search.

---

### `/app-scaffold`

Scaffolds production-ready projects with verified latest versions. Manual-invoke only (`disable-model-invocation: true`) since it creates files and runs commands.

```
/app-scaffold AI chatbot with Next.js and Supabase
/app-scaffold SaaS dashboard with Stripe billing
/app-scaffold CLI tool in Rust
```

**What's created:**
- Clean folder structure following framework conventions
- `CLAUDE.md` — Stack, scripts, conventions, architecture decisions
- `README.md` — Setup instructions with pinned version numbers
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions for lint + test + build
- `tests/example.test.ts` — At least one working test
- `.env.example` — All env vars documented (no real secrets)
- Security defaults: CORS, input validation (zod/joi/pydantic), CSP headers, auth boilerplate

**Post-scaffold validation:** Runs `install`, `build`, and `test` to verify the scaffold actually works before presenting it.

---

## Security Skills

### `/secure-review`

Comprehensive security audit running in forked context. Manual-invoke only.

```
/secure-review
/secure-review src/api/
/secure-review auth-module
```

**Three-layer audit:**

| Layer | What It Does | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Automated | Ghost Security: secrets, deps, SAST, combined report | Ghost plugin (graceful fallback if unavailable) |
| Manual | Auth/authz, injection, data protection, API security, infra, client-side | Code analysis with line-number precision |
| Dependencies | Outdated, deprecated, EOL, supply-chain risk | WebSearch + Ghost scan-deps |

**Output includes:**
- Executive summary with risk level and top 3 actions
- Each finding: severity, confidence (Confirmed/Likely/Possible), OWASP category, CWE, exact code, working fix
- Remediation checklist ordered by priority
- Scan coverage summary table

**Checks git history** for committed `.env` files. Scales audit depth to project size.

---

### `/stack-check`

Audits every dependency with a health score. Runs in forked context.

```
/stack-check
/stack-check ./my-app
```

**Detects:** Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, Rust, Java/Kotlin, PHP, .NET, Docker base images, GitHub Actions, framework configs. Also checks runtime versions.

**For each package:**
- Current version vs. latest stable (verified via web search with date)
- Status: ✅ Current / 🔵 Minor / 🟠 Major / ⚠️ Deprecated / 🔴 EOL / 🚨 Vulnerable
- **Exact upgrade command** (not "consider upgrading")
- Breaking changes and migration notes for major updates

**Health score:** 0-100 with clear scoring formula. **License audit** flags GPL/AGPL in commercial projects. **Upgrade order** ensures safe sequential updates.

---

```

**Capabilities:**
- macOS binary analysis (ARM64/x86_64, Mach-O, code signatures, entitlements)
- Vulnerability assessment with CVSS scoring (full vector breakdowns)
- Defensive monitoring tool development (Python/Bash — detection only, never exploitation)
- Responsible disclosure report generation
- Research organization across 30+ analysis files
- Chromium-based app security (multi-process architecture, IPC, sandbox)

**Output templates:** Vulnerability reports with executive summary + technical details + PoC detection + impact + remediation. Defensive tool templates with mandatory safety headers and ethical guardrails. Research index with attack chain maps and evidence catalogs.

**Strict ethical boundaries:** Defensive only. Creates detection tools, never exploitation tools. Refuses any request that crosses into offensive tooling.

---
