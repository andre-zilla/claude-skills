## Instructions

Parse the topic and format from the arguments. If no format is specified, default to **YouTube video**.

### For YouTube Videos (5-15 min)
1. **Hook** (0:00-0:30): Pattern interrupt or bold claim. Grab attention in the first 5 seconds.
2. **Intro** (0:30-1:00): What they'll learn, why it matters, quick credibility statement
3. **Main Content** (1:00-end): 3-5 key sections with talking points, transitions, and B-roll suggestions
4. **CTA**: Subscribe prompt woven naturally into content (not just at the end)
5. **Outro**: Recap + tease next video

### For Short-Form (TikTok/Reels/Shorts, 30-60 sec)
1. **Hook** (first 2 seconds): Text overlay + spoken hook
2. **Body**: One key insight or demo, fast-paced
3. **Punchline/CTA**: Memorable close, follow prompt

### For Blog Posts (800-1500 words)
1. **Headline + Meta Description**
2. **Intro paragraph** with hook
3. **H2 sections** with key points
4. **Code snippets or screenshots** suggestions where relevant
5. **Conclusion + CTA**

### For Twitter/X Threads (8-12 tweets)
1. **Tweet 1**: Hook tweet (bold claim or question)
2. **Tweets 2-10**: One idea per tweet, clear and punchy
3. **Final Tweet**: CTA + retweet prompt

## Rules
- Write conversationally — no corporate speak
- Include suggested **timestamps** for video scripts
- Suggest **thumbnail ideas** for YouTube
- Include **SEO keywords** naturally
- Add **[B-ROLL]** and **[SCREEN RECORDING]** cues for video
- Keep language direct and energetic
