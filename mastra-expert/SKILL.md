# MastraExpert

Expert guidance for the Mastra TypeScript AI framework — building agents, workflows, memory systems, RAG pipelines, MCP integration, voice capabilities, model routing, evals, observability, server configuration, and deployment.

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| **CreateAgent** | "create agent", "new agent", "build agent", "agent with tools" | `Workflows/CreateAgent.md` |
| **BuildWorkflow** | "create workflow", "build workflow", "orchestrate steps", "suspend resume" | `Workflows/BuildWorkflow.md` |
| **SetupProject** | "setup mastra", "new mastra project", "init mastra", "getting started" | `Workflows/SetupProject.md` |
| **ConfigureMemory** | "add memory", "configure memory", "RAG pipeline", "vector store", "semantic search" | `Workflows/ConfigureMemory.md` |
| **AddEvals** | "add evals", "create scorer", "evaluate agent", "observability", "tracing" | `Workflows/AddEvals.md` |
| **DeployProject** | "deploy mastra", "mastra build", "production deploy", "cloud deploy" | `Workflows/DeployProject.md` |

## Examples

**Example 1: Create an AI agent with tools**
```
User: "Create a Mastra agent that can search and summarize documents"
-> Invokes CreateAgent workflow
-> Guides through Agent class, tool creation, memory setup
-> Generates agent + tool + registration code
```

**Example 2: Build a multi-step workflow**
```
User: "Build a workflow that processes documents with human approval"
-> Invokes BuildWorkflow workflow
-> Guides through createWorkflow, createStep, suspend/resume
-> Generates workflow with HITL pattern
```

**Example 3: Set up a new Mastra project**
```
User: "Set up a new Mastra project with TypeScript"
-> Invokes SetupProject workflow
-> Runs through npx create-mastra@latest or manual install
-> Creates project structure with agent, tool, and Mastra entry point
```

**Example 4: Configure memory and RAG**
```
User: "Add semantic memory to my agent with vector search"
-> Invokes ConfigureMemory workflow
-> Sets up Memory class, vector store, embeddings, chunking
-> Generates complete RAG pipeline code
```

**Example 5: Add evaluation scorers**
```
User: "Add evals to measure my agent's response quality"
-> Invokes AddEvals workflow
-> Creates scorers with createScorer()
-> Sets up CI integration and observability
```

**Example 6: Deploy to production**
```
User: "Deploy my Mastra app to Vercel"
-> Invokes DeployProject workflow
-> Runs mastra build, configures deployment target
-> Sets up environment variables and monitoring
```

## Next Steps
After building with Mastra:
- Run `/stack-check` to verify all dependency versions are current
- Run `/secure-review` to audit the application's security
- Run `/script-writer [Mastra topic] youtube` to create content about the build
